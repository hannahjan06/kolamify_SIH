# 🌸 Kolam Cultural Heritage Web App

Welcome to the **Kolam Web App**, an interactive platform that preserves and promotes **Kolam**, a traditional South Indian floor art. This project combines **AI, cultural heritage, and interactive web design** in a single, easy-to-use prototype.  

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Kolam Classification** | Upload a Kolam image and get AI-predicted motif/type using **EfficientNetB0**. |
| **Kolam Generation** | Generate new Kolam designs using AI. |
| **Chatbot** | Ask questions about Kolam history, symbolism, and techniques through an AI-powered chatbot. |
| **Draw Your Own Kolam** | Draw, color, and save personal Kolams using a canvas tool. |
| **Mood-based Recommendations** | Explore symmetric designs for relaxation or colorful ones for inspiration (art therapy). |

> 💡 **Tip:** Users can explore Kolam as a relaxing, creative experience — combining cultural learning with mood-based art therapy.

> The running prototype only needs `app.py`, `.keras` model, and frontend files.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (canvas API for drawing)  
**Backend:** Python Flask  
**Machine Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras (EfficientNetB0 for classification, optional generative model)  
**Chatbot:** AI model via API (e.g., OpenAI GPT)  
**Deployment (Free options):**  
- Frontend → Vercel (static)  
- Backend → Render (Flask server)

## How to Run Locally

**Clone the repo:**
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/hannahjan06/kolamify_SIH.git
cd kolam_app
```
**Install dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Run the Flask app**
```
python app.py
```
> By default, it will run at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.  
> Open the frontend  
> Open index.html in your browser (or use Flask’s template rendering). All features—upload, generate, chatbot, and drawing—will be functional.

## Training notebooks

For anyone who wants to see our workflow:

- `preprocess_images.ipynb` → Shows how we converted images to matrix form for model input.  
- `train_model.ipynb` → Contains model training, testing, and saving `.keras` files.

---

## 💡 Extra Notes

- **Model files:** Only `kolam_classifier.keras` is needed for running the prototype.  
- **Data:** Original datasets are not included; the prototype runs with the saved model.  
- **Extensibility:** You can add a generative Kolam model, enhanced chatbot, or user login features later.
